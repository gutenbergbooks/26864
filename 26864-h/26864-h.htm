PREFACE
</p>
<p>
<i>
This little volume was written for no reason on earth and with no earthly reason. It just simply happened, on the principle, I suppose that &#34;murder will out.&#34; Murder is a bad thing and so are nonsense rhymes. There is often a valid excuse for murder; there is none for nonsense rhymes. They seem to be a necessary evil to be classed with smallpox, chicken-pox, yellow fever and other irruptive diseases. They are also on the order of the boomerang and eventually rebound and inflict much suffering on the unlucky verse-slinger. So you see nonsense, like a little learning is a dangerous thing and should be handled with as much care as the shotgun which is never known to be loaded.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
A man who writes nonsense may become in time a big gun. But this
</i>
<span class='pagenum'>
[6]
</span>
<i>
is rare; more often he becomes a small bore. This appears paradoxical and will probably require thinking over, but the more you think it over the less you will understand. This is true of parlor magic. It is also true of the magazine poets. It really never pays to think. Thinking is too much like work. After reading these rhymes you will not think that the writer ever did think, which after all is the right way to think.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
When Dryden wrote &#34;Alexander's Feast&#34; he modestly stated that it was the grandest poem ever written. Mr. Dryden evidently believed this or he wouldn't have said so. But then every one did not agree with Mr. Dryden. Now I am going one step further and will positively state that the writer of this volume is the greatest poetical genius who has not yet died in infancy.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
This is an astounding statement but it can be corroborated by admiring friends, for the writer is like a certain
</i>
<span class='pagenum'>
[7]
</span>
<i>
brand of children's food in that he is advertised by his loving friends.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Speaking of &#34;Alexander's Feast&#34; it simply cannot be compared to any one of the finished, poetic gems in this collection because it is so utterly different. The difference is what made Dryden famous. But comparisons are odious, and Mr. Dryden has been dead several years.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
&#34;But what,&#34; you may ask, &#34;is the object of nonsense verse?&#34; Most assuredly to make one laugh. That masterpiece of nonsense &#34;Alice In Wonderland&#34; and its companion volume &#34;Through The Looking Class&#34; are absurd books, but their very absurdity is what appeals to us most. Their author, Mr. Lewis Carroll was, in private life a very sober gentleman (at least we hope so). Nonsense is the salt of life with which we season the dry food of everyday cooking.

Even serious old Longfellow had this feeling in his bones when he wrote the immortal lines which all of us recall from childhood:
</i>
</p>
<div class="apoem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<i>
&#34;There was a little girl</i>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
And she had a little curl</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Which hung way down on her forehead;</i>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
And when she was good,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
She was very good indeed,</i>
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
But when she was bad, she was horrid.&#34;</i>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<i>
This is nonsense pure and simple and even the most ardent admirers of Mr. Longfellow must, when they try to make &#34;forehead&#34; and &#34;horrid&#34; rhyme, admit that it was very poor verse for the author of &#34;Evangeline.&#34;
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Bret Harte flew off at a tangent when he wrote about &#34;Ah Sin, The Chinaman,&#34; a nonsense poem that gave &#34;Bill Nye&#34; his pseudonym. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote &#34;The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay.&#34; Rudyard Kipling is often &#34;caught with the goods

<i>
on him&#34; and Mark Twain wrote an &#34;Ode to Stephen Dowling Botts.&#34;
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
And Great Scott! I almost forgot that even such a gentle, domestic creature as the cow has been the unconscious inspiration of much nonsense and has doubtless often chewed the bitter cud of reflection in deploring her undesired popularity. First she was forced (very much against her will, no doubt) to jump over the moon to the undignified strains of &#34;Hey Diddle, Diddle.&#34; Then, just when beginning to breathe easily again after that astounding performance, Gelett Burgess came along and gave her more notoriety by raising the question as to whether there was such a thing as a &#34;purple cow.&#34; And even today in many of the rural districts there are old farmers who never heard of Burgess and his &#34;purple cow&#34; who will tell you solemnly that &#34;there is a cow of a sort of purplish color.&#34; Which goes to prove that after all nonsense is only sense plus&#8212;NON.

<p>
WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In days gone by, when cows could fly
</p>
<p class="i2">
And goblins rode on bears;
</p>
<p>
When fairies danced upon the green
</p>
<p class="i2">
And giants moped in lairs,
</p>
<p>
There lived alone upon a shelf
</p>
<p class="i2">
A tinsie, winsie little elf.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Just when the stars came out at night
</p>
<p class="i2">
And moonbeams filled the earth with light,
</p>
<p>
Down from his perch this little elf
</p>
<p class="i2">
Would jump and wander by himself.
</p>
<p>
He wore a pair of little wings
</p>
<p class="i2">
Tied in their place by golden strings.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
One day he took a kind of notion
</p>
<p class="i2">
To take a trip upon the ocean.
</p>
<p>
He combed his hair and washed his face
</p>
<p class="i2">
And put his little wings in place,
</p>
<span class='pagenum'>
[14]
</span>
<p>
Then from his shelf he softly stole
</p>
<p class="i2">
And went to see his friend the mole
</p>
<p>
Who gave to him a pea-green boat
</p>
<p class="i2">
And guaranteed that it would float.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A funny thing about this boat
</p>
<p class="i2">
'Twas patterned from a ten-pound note.
</p>
<p>
The little elf was greatly pleased
</p>
<p class="i2">
And laughed until he sneezed and sneezed;
</p>
<p>
He launched his boat upon the sea
</p>
<p class="i2">
And kicked his little heels in glee.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The mole looked on in glad surprise
</p>
<p class="i2">
(For in those days all moles had eyes.)
</p>
<p>
He shouted out a loud farewell
</p>
<p class="i2">
As the little row-boat rose and fell.
</p>
<p>
The elf picked up a golden oar
</p>
<p class="i2">
And soon lost sight of mole and shore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The elf rowed out for quite a way
</p>
<p class="i2">
And in the waves did sport and play,
</p>
<p>
Until at length the sun sank low
</p>
<span class='pagenum'>
[15]
</span>
<p class="i2">
And then he thought it time to go.
</p>
<p>
Now just as luck would have it then
</p>
<p class="i2">
A prowling sea gull left his den.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The savage sea gull loudly laughed
</p>
<p class="i2">
To see an elf in such a craft,
</p>
<p>
And swooping down upon the water
</p>
<p class="i2">
He did a thing he hadn't oughter,
</p>
<p>
For with his strong and sturdy beak
</p>
<p class="i2">
He caused the boat to spring a leak.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He said he longed for a little change
</p>
<p class="i2">
And the bank-note boat was just in range;
</p>
<p>
The poor young elf gave one big holler
</p>
<p class="i2">
Just as the sea gull made a swallow
</p>
<p>
(And this is strange indeed to follow
</p>
<p class="i2">
For a gull himself is just a swallow.)
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The faithful mole heard this loud yell
</p>
<p class="i2">
And rushed down to the shore pell-mell.
</p>
<p>
Alas, alas he was too late
</p>
<p class="i2">
And saw his friend's unhappy fate;
</p>
<span class='pagenum'>
[16]
</span>
<p>
He groaned, and shrieked and tore his fur
</p>
<p class="i2">
And raised an awful din and stir.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The sea gull heard this awful racket
</p>
<p class="i2">
And seized the mole, just like a packet.
</p>
<p>
He carried him across the seas
</p>
<p class="i2">
To teach the young gulls A B C's.
</p>
<p>
But the loving mole went blind with rage
</p>
<p class="i2">
And they had to put him in a cage,
</p>
<p>
And ever since that fatal night
</p>
<p class="i2">
The moles have all been out of sight.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There was once an eccentric old coon,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Who ate dynamite with a spoon,
</p>
<p>
But when he got loaded
</p>
<p class="i2">
The powder exploded&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And now there's a coon in the moon.

<p>
THE COUNTY FAIR.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Oh, let's go out to the county fair
</p>
<p class="i2">
And breathe the balmy country air,
</p>
<p>
And whittle a stick and look at the hosses,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Discuss the farmer's profit and losses.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We'll take a look at the country stock
</p>
<p class="i2">
And drink some milk from a dairy crock;
</p>
<p>
Look at the pigs and admire the chickens,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And try to forget it's hot as the dickens.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Forget there are any political rings
</p>
<p class="i2">
Just think of the butter and eggs and things;
</p>
<p>
So wash off the buggy and hitch up the mare,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And we'll all go out to the county fair.

O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A maddened horse comes down the street,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With waving mane and flying feet.
</p>
<p>
The crowd scatters in every direction;
</p>
<p class="i2">
It looks like a fight at a city election.
</p>
<p>
A big policeman waves his hands,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And the air is full of vague commands,
</p>
<p>
While across the street a retail grocer
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shrieks to his child as the horse draws closer
</p>
<p>
When suddenly out of the mad hubbub,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Steps Jimmie O'Dowd of the Jefferson Club.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Every man there holds his breath&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
To stop the horse means sudden death.
</p>
<p>
But quick as a flash,
</p>
<p class="i2">
O'Dowd makes a dash.
</p>
<p>
With all his might and the horse's mane,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He brings the old plug to a halt again.
</p>
<p>
Then every man there doffs his hat
</p>
<span class='pagenum'>
[19]
</span>
<p class="i2">
And cries &#34;Well, what do you think of that?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Never since the days of Nero

<p class="i2">
Has there been a greater hero.

When spooks and goblins climb the stair;

When bats rush out with muffled wings,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And now and then the door-bell rings;
</p>
<p>
But just the funniest thing of all

SATURDAY ON THE FARM.

<p>
'Tis Saturday morn and all is bright

By nature's own endowing;

I have no time to fool around,

Especially when I'm&#8212;

THE CIRCUS.

<div class="stanza">
<p>
O, the circus parade! O, the circus parade!
</p>
<p class="i2">
It lays all the politics back in the shade,
</p>
<p>
And the merchants forget that they've got any trade,

While many remember they've never been paid

As they rushed out to look at the circus parade;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And preachers who used to be terribly staid

<p>
Yell just like boys at the circus parade.

Every one's there, both the mistress and maid,

All looking on at the circus parade.

Gaze at the ringmaster cracking his whip,

THE EPIC OF THE HOG.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
(Man's Inhumanity to Hogs Makes Countless Thousands Squeal.)
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I lived upon a little farm,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A happy hog was I,
</p>
<p>
I never dreamed of any harm
</p>
<p class="i2">
Nor ever thought to die.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
All day I wallowed in the mud,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And ate the choicest slops.
</p>
<p>
I watched the brindles chew their cud&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The farmer tend his crops.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Upon the hottest days I'd go
</p>
<p class="i2">
And flounder in the river&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I thought that hogs might come and go,
</p>
<p class="i2">
But I would live forever.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then finally I waxed so fat
</p>
<p class="i2">
That I could hardly walk,<span class='pagenum'>[70]</span>
</p>
<p>
And then the farmers gather 'round
</p>
<p class="i2">
And all began to talk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I couldn't understand a word,
</p>
<p class="i2">
All I did was grunt;
</p>
<p>
You see that's all a hog can do&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
It is his only stunt.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But finally they took me out
</p>
<p class="i2">
And put me on a train.
</p>
<p>
I really couldn't move about
</p>
<p class="i2">
And squealed with might and main.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I grunted, grunted as I flew
</p>
<p class="i2">
And moved in vain endeavor,
</p>
<p>
But even then I thought it true
</p>
<p class="i2">
That I would live forever.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And so we came to Packingtown
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where there were hogs galore,
</p>
<p>
I never saw so many hogs
</p>
<p class="i2">
In all my life before.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<span class='pagenum'>

</p>
<p class="i2">
And climb a flight of stairs,
</p>
<p>
We never had a chance to stop

<p class="i2">
Or time to say our prayers.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Loud-squealing hogs above, below
</p>
<p class="i2">
They formed a seething river,
</p>
<p>
For men may come and men may go
</p>
<p class="i2">
But hogs go on forever.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then I saw an iron wheel
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which stood alone in state,
</p>
<p>
And then I heard an awful squeal&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
A hog had met his fate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A devilish chain upon the wheel
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had seized him by the leg;

It was no use to kick and squeal,

<p class="i2">
It was no use to beg.

<p>
THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.<span class='pagenum'>[86]
</span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Far back within an age remote,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which common history fails to note,
</p>
<p>
When dogs could talk, and pigs could sing,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And frogs obeyed a wooden king,
</p>
<p>
There lived a tribe of rats so mean,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That such a set was never seen.
</p>
<p>
For during all the livelong day
</p>
<p class="i2">
They fought and quarrelled in the hay,
</p>
<p>
And then at night they robbed the mice,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Who always were so kind and nice.
</p>
<p>
They stole their bread, they stole their meat,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And all the jam they had to eat;
</p>
<p>
They gobbled up their pies and cake,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And everything the mice could bake;
</p>
<p>
They stuffed themselves with good fresh meal,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And ruined all they could not steal;<span class='pagenum'>[87]</span>
</p>
<p>
They slapped their long tails in the butter
</p>
<p class="i2">
Until they made a frightful splutter;
</p>
<p>
Then, sleek and fine in coats of silk,
</p>
<p class="i2">
They swam about in buttermilk.
</p>
<p>
They ate up everything they found,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And flung the plates upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
And catching three mice by their tails,
</p>
<p class="i2">
They drowned them in the water-pails;
</p>
<p>
Then seeing it was morning light,
</p>
<p class="i2">
They scampered home with all their might.
</p>
<p>
The mouse-tribe living far and near,
</p>
<p class="i2">
At once this awful thing did hear,
</p>
<p>
And all declared with cries of rage,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A war against the rats they'd wage.
</p>
<p>
The mouse-king blew a trumpet blast,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And soon the mice came thick and fast
</p>
<p>
From every place, in every manner,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And crowded round the royal banner.
</p>
<p>
Each had a sword, a bow and arrow;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Each felt as brave as any sparrow,
</p>
<p>
And promised, in the coming fight,<span class='pagenum'>[88]</span>
</p>
<p class="i2">
To die or put the rats to flight.
</p>
<p>
The king put on a coat of mail,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And tied a bow-knot to his tail;
</p>
<p>
He wore a pistol by his side,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And on a bull-frog he did ride.
</p>
<p>
&#34;March on!&#34; he cried. And, hot and thick,
</p>
<p class="i2">
His army rushed, in double quick.
</p>
<p>
And hardly one short hour had waned,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Before the ranks the rat-camp gained,
</p>
<p>
With sounding drum and screaming fife,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Enough to raise the dead to life.
</p>
<p>
The rats, awakened by the clatter,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Rushed out to see what was the matter,
</p>
<p>
Then down the whole mouse-army flew,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And many thieving rats it slew.
</p>
<p>
The mice hurrahed, the rats they squealed,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And soon the dreadful battle-field
</p>
<p>
Was blue with smoke and red with fire,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And filled with blood and savage ire.
</p>
<p>
The rats had eaten so much jam,
</p>
<p class="i2">
So many pies and so much ham,<span class='pagenum'>[89]</span>
</p>
<p>
And were so fat and sick and swollen
</p>
<p class="i2">
With all the good things they had stolen
</p>
<p>
That they could neither fight nor run;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And so the mice the battle won.
</p>
<p>
They threw up rat-fur in the air;
</p>
<p class="i2">
They piled up rat-tails everywhere;
</p>
<p>
And slaughtered rats bestrewed the ground
</p>
<p class="i2">
For ten or twenty miles around.
</p>
<p>
The rat-king galloped from the field
</p>
<p class="i2">
When all the rest were forced to yield;
</p>
<p>
But though he still retained his skin,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He nearly fainted with chagrin,
</p>
<p>
To think that in that bloody tide
</p>
<p class="i2">
So many of his rats had died.
</p>
<p>
Fierce anger blazed within his breast;
</p>
<p class="i2">
He would not stop to eat or rest;
</p>
<p>
But spurring up his fiery steed,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He seized a sharp and trusty reed&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Then, wildly shouting, rushed like hail
</p>
<p class="i2">
To cut off little mouse-king's tail.
</p>
<p>
The mouse-king's face turned red with passion<span class='pagenum'>[90]</span>
</p>
<p class="i2">
To see a rat come in such fashion,
</p>
<p>
For he had just that minute said
</p>
<p class="i2">
That every thieving rat was dead.
</p>
<p>
The rat was scared, and tried to run,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And vowed that he was just in fun;
</p>
<p>
But nought could quell the mouse-king's fury&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
He cared not then for judge or jury;
</p>
<p>
And with his sharp and quivering spear,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He pierced the rat right through the ear.
</p>
<p>
The rat fell backward in the clover,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Kicked up his legs, and all was over.
</p>
<p>
The mice, with loud and joyful tones,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Now gathered all the bad rats' bones,
</p>
<p>
And with them built a pyramid,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Down which their little children slid.
</p>
<p>
And after that eventful day
</p>
<p class="i2">
The mice in peace and joy could play,
</p>
<p>
For now no wicked rats could steal
</p>
<p class="i2">
Their cakes and jam and pies and meal,
</p>
<p>
Nor catch them by their little tails,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And drown them in the water-pails.

Things Worth While.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To sit and dream in a shady nook
</p>
<p>
While the phantom clouds roll by;
</p>
<p>
To con some long-remembered book
</p>
<p>
When the pulse of youth beats high.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To thrill when the dying sunset glows
</p>
<p>
Through the heart of a mystic wood,
</p>
<p>
To drink the sweetness of some wild rose,
</p>
<p>
And to find the whole world good.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To bring unto others joy and mirth,
</p>
<p>
And keep what friends you can;
</p>
<p>
To learn that the rarest gift on earth
</p>
<p>
Is the love of your fellow man.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To hold the respect of those you know,
</p>
<p>
To scorn dishonest pelf;
</p>
<p>
To sympathize with another's woe,
</p>
<p>
And just be true to yourself.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To find that a woman's honest love
</p>
<p>
In this great world of strife
</p>
<p>
Gleams steadfast like a star, above
</p>
<p>
The dark morass of life.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To feel a baby's clinging hand,
</p>
<p>
To watch a mother's smile;
</p>
<p>
To dwell once more in fairyland&#8212;
</p>
<p>
These are the things worth while.
